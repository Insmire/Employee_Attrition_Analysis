# Employee Attrition Prediction and Analysis
## *Predicting Attrition and Exploring Causes Based on Internal Business and Personal Factors*
### Project Overview: (explain basic project process)
---
</br>
Intimately understanding employee attrition and its causes empowers organizations from any sector to retain the most skilled workers, save on costly training, and improve overall organizational culture and employee sentiment.  While attrition is a problem that effects every industry, use of our predictive models and findings are most helpful for large-scale organizations, where individual sentiment often flies under the radar and employees fall through the cracks.  
</br>
</br>

Our analysis and predictions can assist employers with getting to the root of employee grievances, guide management on timing for engagement with their employees, raises or role restructuring, and improve the workplace environment for the employees. (To develop further purpose based on additional dataset, widening scope to either how attrition affects the customer base or more about the employees?)

### Project Outline for 1st Segment (delete or work parts into other sections of readme later)

Selected topic: Employee Attrition

Reason we selected topic: Interested in looking at human behavior in a way that is business-oriented, and has a lot of room for exploratory analysis.  

Description of dataset: The attrition dataset is manufactured with fictional HR employee information by IBM data scientists.  It contains 1,470 instances or rows, and 35 columns or features including the target.  Features are a combination of personal employee data, answers to questionairres, employee's position-related data, and whether each employee has left the company.

Questions we hope to answer with the data: which features are most heavily weighted.  Can the features be categorized so that they are ranked by the order that drives the most cause for leaving? Can the employee intervene on these causes?  When can or should they intervene?  How?  Potentially how employing these interventions can improve the employee and/or client experience.  

Potential languages/libraries:  

    hvplot
    plotly
    PySpark
    Python
    Scikit-learn
    SQL (if time)
</br>

Potential machine-learning models:

    Unsupervised (need to select)
    supervised
    Neural network (if time)
    
    NEED TO COMPLETE: Team members will be expected to present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model
    and accomplishes the following:
    -Takes in data from the provisional database
    -Outputs label for input data
</br>

Database Integration:

    Postgres
    
    NEED TO COMPLETE: Team members will be expected to present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
    -Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
    -Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database

## Results
</br>

(Which factors were most heavily weighted?  Individually and/or by categories of sorts?  Personal, work environment, etc.  Can we improve attrition rate by adjusting the inputs?)
